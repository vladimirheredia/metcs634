# METCS634 Final Project

This project was composed of two sprints and a team of 3.

The main purpose for this project was to learn how to work in an Agile team. Given the timing of the course, it only allowed for two sprints but we had to implement what we learned in the class. Some of the things we did to complete this project were:

* Assign roles in the team (I was the developer)
  * Developer, Scrum Master, Product Owner
* We had daily 10 minutes meetings
* We used Trello as a Kanban to keep track of the project and who was doing what
  * link to Trello board: https://trello.com/b/JlTNGKyK/kanban-board
* We used Adobe XD to create the design
* Created responsive single page app in HTML, CSS & JQuery
* For communication we used Slack


# Description
In this course we had a comprehensive overview of the principles, processes, and practices of agile software development. We learned techniques for initiating, planning and executing on software development projects using agile methodologies. We also obtained practical knowledge of agile development frameworks and learn how to distinguish between agile and traditional project management methodologies.

We learned how to apply agile tools and techniques in the software development lifecycle from project ideation to deployment, including establishing an agile team environment, roles and responsibilities, communication and reporting methods, and embracing change.
